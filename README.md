# Online Bookstore Website (Full-stack Web)

Full-stack web application for an online bookstore.  
Users can browse and view book details, while admins can manage book data through an admin panel.

This project was developed as part of my Computer Science studies to practice full-stack web development, database design, and CRUD operations.
